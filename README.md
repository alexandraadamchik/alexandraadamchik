# Welcome to My Professional Coding Repository! üåå

Hello world!
I'm Alexandra, a skilled web developer proficient in the MERN stack. I specialize in crafting websites, dynamic apps and full-stack e-commerce projects.
In my previous role as a Math Tutor, I applied mathematical concepts, analytics, and logical reasoning. Always having an interest in technology I made the decision to study web development at DCI, aiming to integrate these interests into my job.
Throughout a 1.5-year full-time course, I actively participated in practical projects for hypothetical clients. What I particularly enjoy about web development is the opportunity to apply my creative tendencies alongside analytical thinking.
As I keep going on this learning path, my dedication to skill development grows each day. I'm well-prepared for the upcoming challenges and eagerly look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills, making a meaningful impact in my first position.

Skills: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Node.js, MongoDB, mySQL,  Git, Project Management, Teamwork, Communication, Organisation.
